Hi!
starting the app: 
`npm install && npm run dev`
uploading new words:
please use the `words` endpoint, with a 'method' search param for choosing upload type.
examples:
1. for data on request:
curl -d "Hi! My name is (what?), my name is (who?), my name is Slim Shady" -X POST http://localhost:3000/words?method=data
2. for a file path in request
3. for the uri request
4. for fetching a statistic - 
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/statistic?word=who
